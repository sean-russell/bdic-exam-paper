# bdic-exam-paper
This repo contains a class file which useful for creating an exam paper. First created by Sean Russell, hopefully this will have more features and examples to allow for easy creation of papers.

The feature list I currently envisage:
* Automatic creation of paper from a question bank
* Randomization of questions to create equivalent but separate versions of the same paper
* Randomization of multiple-choice or binary choice options in choice-based questions (probably based on examdesign/exams class file)
* Generation of answer-key for each version of randomized choice-based questions
